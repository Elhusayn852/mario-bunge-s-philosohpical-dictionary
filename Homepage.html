        <h1>About Mario Bunge</h1>
        <p class="hero-section__aboutbungepara">
          Mario Bunge (1919–2020) was a towering figure in contemporary
          philosophy, renowned for his rigorous defense of scientific realism
          and his systematic approach to the philosophy of science. An Argentine
          physicist and philosopher, Bunge authored over 80 books and 500
          papers, most notably his monumental Treatise on Basic Philosophy, an
          eight-volume work that covers semantics, ontology, epistemology,
          ethics, and political philosophy. Passionate about clarity and logic,
          he championed a worldview grounded in scientific rationality and
          opposed relativism, mysticism, and pseudoscience. Bunge’s legacy lies
          in his commitment to unifying science and philosophy, making both more
          accessible, precise, and impactful in addressing the world’s pressing
          intellectual and practical challenges.

          “We all would like to know more and, at the same time, to receive less
          information. In fact, the problem of a worker in today's knowledge
          industry is not the scarcity of information but its excess. The same
          holds for professionals: just think of a physician or an executive,
          constantly bombarded by information that is at best irrelevant. In
          order to learn anything we need time. And to make time we must use
          information filters allowing us to ignore most of the information
          aimed at us. We must ignore much to learn a little.”
